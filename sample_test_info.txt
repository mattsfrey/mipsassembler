Information about sample inputs for Program IV
----------------------------------------------

  There are three test cases. The input files for these 
test cases are called test1.asm, test2.asm and test3.asm.

  Of the three test cases, test1.asm and test2.asm don't contain any
syntax errors. Thus, your program must produce object files for these
two inputs. Object files for these two test cases are test1.obj and
test2.obj respectively.

  The input file test3.asm contains several syntax errors.
So, your program must produce the corresponding error file.
The error file for this test case is test3.err.

Note: In obj files, you may print hex digits 'A' through 'F' in upper or
      lower case. Further, you can also choose to print 4 hex characters for
      the address (with leading zeros, if necessary) and 8 hex characters
      for the contents (with leading zeros, if necessary).
