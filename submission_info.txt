            CSI 402 -- Notes about Programming Assignment IV
            ================================================

  Please read the information included in this file carefully and
follow the directions. Program submissions not conforming to the 
directions specified below are likely to lose almost all of 
the credit.

Information concerning makefile:
--------------------------------

   The makefile that you provide MUST have the name "makefile" 
(without the double quotes). 

  The makefile MUST have two targets called p4 and clean. (The names
p4 and clean MUST NOT be changed.)  The first target (p4) must be the
default. That is, when we run make WITHOUT specifying a target, a file
called p4 containing the executable version of your program must be
produced.  When we run make with clean as the target, it should delete
all the ".o" files and the file named core (if any).

Information Concerning Electronic Submission:
---------------------------------------------

VERY IMPORTANT NOTES: 
---------------------

  (0) Make sure that at the top of each of your header files, 
      C source files and makefile, your first and last name and 
      your Unix login id are included as comments. 

  (1) To submit your files electronically, you must have the files on 
      one of the Unix machines (itsunix.albany.edu) supported by 
      Information Technology Services (ITS) unit of UAlbany. Also, 
      you must be logged on to one of those machines to actually 
      carry out the electronic submission. 

  (2) Make sure that your program compiles and produces correct 
      results on the Unix machines supported by ITS.  Programs that 
      cause compiler or linker errors will NOT receive any credit. 

  (3) Using the turnin-csi402 program as discussed below is the ONLY
      acceptable way of submitting programming assignments in 
      this course.  You should NOT mail the files to the 
      instructor or to the TAs.

  (5) DON'T turn in unnecessary files (e.g. object files with 
      extension ".o" created by compiling C source files, 
      executable files such as "a.out", etc.). 

  Remember that you must submit all the necessary header files (with 
extension ".h"), all the necessary C source files (with 
extension ".c") and the makefile.  To submit these files 
electronically, you would type the following command to the 
(Unix) operating system:

   /usr/local/bin/turnin-csi402 -c csi402  *.c  *.h  makefile

(We are assuming that your working directory at the time when you
issue the above command contains only those header files, the C 
source files and the makefile that you want to submit.)

  After you issue the above command, the system responds with:

    Your files have been submitted to csi402, prog4 for grading.

In the above message, "prog4" refers to the name of the project
that is currently active. If you submit your program after 11 PM
on Wednesday, Apr. 13, 2011 (but before 11 PM on Friday, Apr. 15, 
2011), your submission will go to the project called "prog4-late".
Attempts to submit the program after 11 PM, Friday, Apr. 15, 2011 
will fail.

Additional information about the turnin program: 
------------------------------------------------

 (a) If you use the turnin command above again at a later time
     (before the deadline), then the files submitted previously would be
     replaced by the newly submitted files. (This allows you to resubmit
     a program if the previous submission was erroneous.)

(b) At any time, you can obtain the names of the files that you
     have submitted to the current project using the following command:

         /usr/local/bin/turnin-csi402 -c csi402 -v
